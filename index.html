        <p class="about_p">My name is Anthony Manjarrez, I am 16 years old, and I attend Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. My family is from Mexico, with me being first gen. I belong to a family of five, with me being the oldest of my two other siblings. I am in many programs and have lots of hobbies. For example, I love playing guitar, coding, soccer, playing video games, and collecting shoes. I also love spending time with friends and family, often going to Manhattan and exploring the city. I am an aspiring software engineering with dreams of working for a big tech company. Through various coding programs like All Star Code I have the ability to create websites like these.</p>

            <p class="ASC_text">All Star Code is a 6 week summer intensive where students, like myself, get taught coding languages like HTML and CSS. They give young men of color an opportunity to learn about the tech world and experiment with it. It is an amazing program with an amazing community and have grown to be very fond of the program.</p>
